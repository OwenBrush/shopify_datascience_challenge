# Question 1:

*On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.*

 - *Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.*
 - *What metric would you report for this datset?*
 - *What is its value?*



**Thoughts:**

Exploring the data I discovered two clear outliers that were the result of the higher than expected AOV.

The first is a handful bulk purchases of quantities of 2000 items each.  I would suggest filtering these out from the results as the average order value for individual customer purchases should probably be considered seperately from those of bulk purchases. 

The second is an extremely expensive sneaker at shop 78 for $25,725.00. I would also suggest filtering these from the results as they would appear to be a luxury or collector item in their own category.

Both of these outliers are each respectively unique to a single store, and it would also be worth while speaking with someone at these stores to ensure this data is accurate and not the result of an error.  I would also want to consult with someone in the buisness department before implementing any thresholds that determine whether a purchase is bulk or not, or if an item is of high enough value to be in it's own category.

**Final Answer:**

I would report an AOV with both of these outliers filtered out, as it gives the best impression of the orders being made at the typical sneaker store.  However I would also note the outliers that had been removed from that calculation and bring attention to the signifigance that they hold in their own right.
